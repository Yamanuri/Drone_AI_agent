# Technical Assignment: Drone Operations Coordinator AI Agent

## Problem Statement

Skylark Drones operates a fleet of drones and pilots across multiple client projects simultaneously. Currently, a drone operations coordinator manually handles:

- **Pilot roster management**: Tracking who's available, on leave, or assigned to projects
- **Assignment coordination**: Matching the right pilot to the right project based on skills, location, and availability
- **Drone inventory**: Tracking which drones are available, in maintenance, or deployed where
- **Conflict resolution**: Detecting scheduling conflicts, skill mismatches, and equipment issues

**The Challenge:** This is a high-context, high-coordination role that requires constant context-switching between spreadsheets, messages, and project management tools. An AI agent could significantly improve efficiency and reduce coordination overhead.

**Your Task:** Build an AI agent that can handle the core responsibilities of a drone operations coordinator.

## Sample Data

You will receive two reference CSV/Google Sheets:

1. **Pilot Roster** — Sample fields may include: name, skill level, certifications, drone experience, current location, current assignment, status
2. **Drone Fleet** — Sample fields may include: model, serial number, capabilities, current assignment, status, location

These are indicative samples. You may add columns or fields as necessary for your implementation.

## Core Features

Your agent must handle these four areas:

### 1. Roster Management
- Query pilot availability by skill, certification, location
- View current assignments
- Update pilot status (Available / On Leave / Unavailable) — *must sync back to Google Sheet*

### 2. Assignment Tracking
- Match pilots to projects based on requirements
- Track active assignments
- Handle reassignments

### 3. Drone Inventory
- Query fleet by capability, availability, location
- Track deployment status
- Flag maintenance issues
- Update status  - sync back to google sheets.

### 4. Conflict Detection
- Double-booking detection (pilot or drone assigned to overlapping projects)
- Skill/certification mismatch warnings
- Equipment-pilot location mismatch alerts

### Edge Cases You Must Handle
- Pilot assigned to overlapping project dates
- Pilot assigned to job requiring certification they lack
- Drone assigned but currently in maintenance
- Pilot and assigned drone in different locations

## Bonus Requirement (not optional)

> "The agent should help coordinate urgent reassignments"

How you interpret and implement this is up to you. Document your interpretation in your Decision Log.

## Integration Requirements

**Google Sheets — 2-way sync **
- **Read:** All data from both sheets (Pilot Roster and Drone Fleet)
- **Write:** Pilot status updates must sync back to the Pilot Roster sheet

## Deliverables

### 1. Hosted Prototype (Required)
- Working agent accessible via link
- Platform of your choice (Replit, Vercel, Railway, HuggingFace Spaces, etc.)
- Must be testable without local setup

### 2. Decision Log (Required, 2 page max)
- Key assumptions you made
- Trade-offs chosen and why
- What you'd do differently with more time
- How you interpreted "urgent reassignments"

### 3. Source Code
- ZIP file
- README with architecture overview

## Technical Expectations

- **Conversational Interface**: The user will interact with your agent conversationally, handle that to the best of your (agents') ability
- **Google Sheets Integration**: 2-way as specified above
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases and conflicts
- **Tech Stack**: Your choice — justify your decisions in the Decision Log

## Timeline

**6 hours**

## Questions?

If you have clarifying questions, document your assumptions and proceed. Part of the evaluation is seeing how you handle ambiguity and make decisions with incomplete information.

**Good luck!**
